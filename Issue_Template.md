Before opening an issue:

- [Search for duplicate or closed issues](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).
- Read the [FAQ](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).

When something isn’t working, include:

- Your style guide config (`styleguide.config.js`).
- Webpack version.
- Operating system, browser and version if it’s a layout bug.
- Reproducible demo:
  1. Fork the [example project](https://github.com/styleguidist/example).
  2. Modify it to reproduce the issue.
  3. Push to GitHub and paste the link here.

By doing this, you’re saving us a lot of time! Reproducible issues get fixed faster.
